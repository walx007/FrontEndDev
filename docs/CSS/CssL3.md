### the Flexible Box Module CSS  
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. 
Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.  

Flexbox (the Flexible Box Module) is a set of CSS rules for stretching multiple columns or rows across a parent container. 
 Flex is unique amongst CSS properties because you have a main container and the items nested within it. CSS flex has properties that 
 apply to both the element itself, and the items inside of it.  
 
 * To use flexbox set the display property of the parent container to flex:

```.container{
  display:flex;
}```


>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:  
> - Block, for sections in a webpage  
> - Inline, for text  
> - Table, for two-dimensional table data  
> - Positioned, for explicit position of an element.  
The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.




#### FlexBox  - The css Flex box module specilizes in *ligning* and *distributing* elements within a parent element.

The alignment and justification can be made easliy by softwares (illustrator), but untill flex box it was difficult to align and distrubite elements 
in a appealing way just by code.  
- The flex container can expand to fit items/children elements inside it.  
- To use flexbox set the display property of a div to flex. The items inside that element will automatically become flex items, and you can then use the flexbox syntax in your CSS code.
