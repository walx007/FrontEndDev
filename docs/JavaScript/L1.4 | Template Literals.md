- Prior to ES6, the old way to concatenate strings together was by using the string concatenation operator ( + )/ String's concat() method.

- This works alright in normal string concats, but it gets more complicated when you need to build multi-line strings.

`let note = teacher.name + ',\n\n' +
  'Please excuse ' + student.name + '.\n' +
  'He is recovering from the flu.\n\n' +
  'Thank you,\n' +
  student.guardian;`
  
  
  > Returns:
> Mrs. Wilson,

> Please excuse Richard Kalehoff.
> He is recovering from the flu.

> Thank you,
> Mr. Kalehoff

However, thatâ€™s changed with the introduction of template literals (previously referred to as "template strings" in development releases of ES6).

#### Template Literals
Template literals are essentially string literals that include embedded expressions.

Denoted with backticks (` `) instead of single quotes ( '' ) or double quotes ( "" ),
template literals can contain placeholders which are represented using ${expression}. This makes it much easier to build strings.

Ex:
let message = `${student.name} please see ${teacher.name} in ${teacher.room} to pick up your report card.`;

> TIP:
Embedded expressions inside template literals can do more than just reference variables. 
You can perform operations, call functions and use loops inside embedded expressions!
