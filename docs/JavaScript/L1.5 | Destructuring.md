##### Destructuring  
- The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays,
or properties from objects, into distinct variables.  
- It allows you to specify the elements you want to extract from an array or object on the left side of an assignment. It sounds a little weird, 
but you can actually achieve the same result as before, but with much less code; and it's still easy to understand.

#### Why Destructuring assignment
- Have to much less code w.r.t normal assignment method.
- easy to understand
